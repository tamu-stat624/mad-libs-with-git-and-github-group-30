Title: The Galactic Adventure

Dear Joe,

I am writing to you from a funny spaceship in an analytical galaxy. I found myself here one day after
going for a ride on a green rocket in April. There are Seven Leaves and Cities of Hound here! In the
Bedroom there is a pool full of Coke. I fall asleep each night on a huge rug of
wood and dream of running slowly. It feels as though I have lived here for
100 years. I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here now is
hopping on a nano probe!!

Best wishes,
Karthik
